Using CLIPS to create a rule-based expert system to navigate Zones 1,2 of the London tube map.

The London Tube is a complex transportation system comprising 11 lines, covering nine zones, and offering connections to various rail services. This report provides an overview of part 2 of the project wherein we aimed to create an expert system that allows travelers to navigate through the complex London underground network.

Our goals were to explore in detail the requirements of creating such an expert system and to create suitable rules and functions to obtain the desired outcome. Further, we also worked on creating a simple, option-based interface that allows users to interact with the expert system and use the information in the knowledge base to plan their next exciting outcome in London!
